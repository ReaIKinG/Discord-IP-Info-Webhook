# Discord IP Info Webhook

This JavaScript code allows you to retrieve IP information and send it to a Discord webhook. It collects details about the visitor's IP address, location, and VPN usage, and sends an embed message to a Discord channel. It can be useful for tracking website visitors or monitoring IP activity.

## Getting Started

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Set up a Discord webhook URL for receiving the IP information. Replace the `webhookUrl` variable in the code with your webhook URL.

2. Make sure you have a token from [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) to retrieve the IP information. Replace the `token` parameter in the `ipInfoUrl` and `vpnInfoUrl` variables with your token.

3. Include the code in your web page or script.

4. When a visitor accesses your web page, their IP information will be sent to the Discord webhook.
